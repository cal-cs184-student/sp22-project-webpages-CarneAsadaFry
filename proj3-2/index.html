		<h1> Project 3-2 </h1>
		<h2> Overview </h2>
		<p>
			We completed Parts 1 and 2 of the project. In this project, we implemented more complicated materials like glass, mirrors,
			and microfacet materials in our ray tracer. In Part 1, implementing mirrors and refracting materials. To do this,
			we had to calculate the paths for reflecting and refracting rays, the latter of which involved considering the material's
			index of refraction. We then used these functions to build the sample_f functions for mirrors and refracting materials,
			where we returned the radiance at a point and provided an incoming ray, as well as a pdf. Then, we combined these two
			material types using Schlick's approximation to create a glass material which has both reflective and refractive characteristics.
			In Part 2, we implemented microfacet materials. We first created the evaluation function, which consisted of several terms
			that had to be implemented which relied on the geometry of the collision and the physical properties of the material. After
			creating the evaluation function, we implemented importance sampling for the Beckmann distribution, which made our sampling
			much more likely to select rays that contribute to the radiance of the object, which means we get a much clearer image
			with less computation. Luckily, we did not run into any major difficulties with this project. The largest difficulty
			we had was confusing ourselves over floating point arithmetic, where we thought that we had a rounding error that
			turned out to not be a problem. From this, we better learned to reason carefully about which data types are appropriate
			in which situation. Besides that, our implementation went relatively smoothly. </p>
		<h2> Part 1 </h2>
		<p>
			We started by implementing the reflect helper function, which simply takes in a ray in object coordinates and 
			outputs its reflection about the normal vector. Since this is just along the z-axis, we simply flip the x and y coordinates.
			Next, we implemented sample_f for the mirror material. This is a delta BSDF that simply reflects all the rays,
			so we just update wi using the reflect function, set the pdf to 1, and return the reflectance with an additional factor
			that cancels out the cosine factor introduced in at_least_one_bounce_radiance. Next, we implemented the refract helper
			function. We used the z coordinate of wo to check if we were entering or exiting the material to correctly calculated
			the ratio of indices of refraction, eta. Then, we checked for total internal reflection. If we do not have this,
			we used Snell's law and some geometry to derive the expression for wi. Then, we implemented sample_f for RefractionBSDFs.
			We used refract to check for total internal reflection, and if this did not happen, to calculate wi. Then, we again take
			the pdf to be 1 and we return the transmittance normalized by eta^2, and a factor that cancels with the cosine term
			in at_least_one_bounce_radiance. The normalization by eta^2 captures the physical properties of the radiance. Finally,
			we implemented glass materials. If there is total internal reflection, we only include reflection effects. Otherwise, we
			compute Schlick's reflection coefficent, R, and then randomly decide to either reflect or refract, where the choice is weighted
			by R. We then sample as before, but the pdfs and returned radiance are weighted by the probability of picking the case. </p>

			We first show CBspheres_refract.dae rendered with 512 samples per pixel, 4 samples per light, and max ray depth 100. </p>
		<h3> Refractive Sphere </h3>

		<p>
			We notice that the sphere in the front does not reflect the top light source because it is a RefractionBSDF in this file,
			and thus does not reflect any light. The sphere in the back is a MirrorBSDF, so it only reflects, and we can see the top light source. </p>
		<p>
			We now show CBspheres.dae rendered with 512 samples per pixel, 4 samples per light, and with max ray depths of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 100. </p>

			With 0 bounces, we only have the direct light source. With 1 bounce, we can now see the parts of the scene that are directly
			lit by the light source, but we cannot yet see the glass or mirror materials. With 2 bounces, we can now see the mirror sphere,
			because the rays that bounce once and then reflect off the sphere. However, in our reflection, only parts of the scene
			which are directly lit appear lit, since we only have one bounce before the reflection.
			We also get the reflective component of the glass material, but we do not get refraction yet. 
			We also overall get more even lighting in the scene. At 3 bounces, we now get refraction in the glass sphere and
			a more evenly lit reflection in mirror sphere, but we still cannot see the glass sphere in the mirror sphere since
			we only have two bounces before reflection. We need at least 3 bounces to see refraction because we need a bounce to reach
			the sphere, one to enter, and a third to leave.  At 4 bounces, we can now correctly see the glass sphere in the 
			reflection of the mirror sphere, since we get three bounces before the reflection. Going to 5 bounces and then 100,
			the scene simply becomes more evenly lit, with no dramatic additional effects that appear. </p>
		<h2> Part 2 </h2>
		<p>
			We started by implementing the microfacet BRDF evaluation function f in terms of the Fresnel term, the shadow-masking term, and
			the normal distribution function. We had to calculate the half-vector h, which we did using wo and wi with the formula from
			lecture. Next, we implemented the normal distribution function using the Beckmann distribution. For this, we needed theta_h,
			which we got by first finding cos(theta_h) and taking the arccos. After that, we implemented the Fresnel term. To do this,
			we calculated Rs and Rp terms for R, G, and B using fixed wavelengths, and then using the corresponding indices of refraction
			eta and k. We then used Rs and Rp to find F. Finally, we implemented importance sampling for sampling from the Beckmann
			distribution. To do this, we first used the inversion method to randomly sample angles theta and phi. Then, we converted these into
			angles to a point on the unit sphere to get a half vector h. Next, we go our wi by reflecting wo across h. Then,
			we used the distributions for the angle to find the pdf for wi. Finally, we made sure wi was valid by checking if the z component
			was greater than zero, and then we returned f(wi,wo) after updating wi and the pdf. </p>

			Now, we show the gold dragon image with four different values for the alpha parameter. The dragon was rendered with 128 samples
			per pixel, 1 sample per light, and a maximum of 5 bounces. </p>
		<h3> Golden Dragon, Alpha 0.005 </h3>
		<img src="dragon0005.png" width="480" height="360">
		<h3> Golden Dragon, Alpha 0.05 </h3>
		<img src="dragon005.png" width="480" height="360">
		<h3> Golden Dragon, Alpha 0.25 </h3>
		<img src="dragon025.png" width="480" height="360">
		<h3> Golden Dragon, Alpha 0.5 </h3>
		<img src="dragon05.png" width="480" height="360">
		<p>
			We see that as alpha increases, the dragon becomes less shiny and more diffuse. It also appears brighter at larger alpha values.
			Additionally, we notice that the image becomes more noisy, with random white spots,
			at smaller alpha values. The noise at small alpha values happens
			because the pdf becomes very small at some points when we use a small alpha.
			This causes the radiance to spike, leading to white spots at various points. </p>
		<p>
			Next, we compare the copper bunny with hemisphere sampling versus with importance sampling. We use 64 samples per pixel, 1 
			sample per light, and a maximum ray depth of 5. </p>
		<h3> Copper Bunny, Hemisphere Sampling </h3>
		<img src="bunny_hemisphere.png" width="480" height="360">
		<h3> Copper Bunny, Importance Sampling </h3>
		<img src="bunny_importance.png" width="480" height="360">
		<p>
			We notice that the bunny with hemisphere sampling is very noisy with many dark spots. This is because we are using relatively
			few samples, and we are picking our samples uniformly, and so we end up picking samples with no reflective light. In the importance
			sampling bunny, we no longer have the many dark spots because we are much more likely to sample rays that are relevant to the
			reflectance. </p>
		<p>
			Finally, we show a dragon which has been given the optical constants of cobalt. The eta values were (2.1841, 2.05, 1.7925) for RGB
			and the k values were (4.0971, 3.82, 3.3775) for RGB. To find these values, we used 
			<a href="https://refractiveindex.info"> https://refractiveindex.info </a>.
			We also used an alpha value of 0.25. We rendered with 128 samples
			per pixel, 1 sample per light, and a maximum of 5 bounces. </p>

		<h2> Collaboration </h2>
		<p>
			We again completed this project using the pair programming technique, where we had a driver and a navigator.
			However, we switched rolls since last time.
			The collaboration went well overall, with both of us contributing to the conceptual
			strategy, and practical implementation.
			Overall, in this project we learned how to implement more complicated materials in a ray tracer using a combination
			of geometry and the physical properties of materials, and we learned which different physical properties are relevant
			and how they affect the look of a material.
			But, again, our biggest lesson was that in computer graphics, the most powerful algorithm is friendship.</p>
