		<h2> Overview </h2>
		<p>
			Overview here. </p>
		<h2> Part 1 </h2>
		<p>
			We first show the cloth wireframe with different constraints. </p>
		<h3> Wireframe, No Shear </h3>
		<img src="no_shear.png" width="480" height="auto">
		<h3> Wireframe, Only Shear </h3>
		<img src="only_shear.png" width="480" height="auto">
		<h3> Wireframe, All Constraints </h3>
		<img src="all_constraints.png" width="480" height="auto">
		<p>
			Comparing the different images, we see that the shearing constraints connect different masses diagonally, while the 
			structural and bending constraints connect masses in a line. </p>
		
		<h2> Part 2 </h2>
		<p>
			We first show the cloth pinned at 2 points, with different parameters changed. </p>
		<h3> 2 Point Pinned Cloth, k = 10 N/m </h3>
		<img src="k_10.png" width="480" height="auto">
		<h3> 2 Point Pinned Cloth, k = 100000 N/m </h3>

		<h3> 2 Point Pinned Cloth, 10000 g/cm^2 </h3>

		<h3> 2 Point Pinned Cloth, 0% Damping </h3>
		<img src="damp_0.png" width="480" height="auto">
		<h3> 2 Point Pinned Cloth, 100% Damping </h3>

			First, we notice that as we change k, the cloth falls at the same speed, but it hangs lower around the 2 pinned points and becomes
			more wrinkled when the spring constant is lower, since the springs stretch more easily. When the spring constant it very high,
			the cloth is more stiff and becomes less wrinkled. Next, we notice that changing the density also does not change the speed at
			which the cloth falls. However, at low density, the cloth is more stiff and less wrinkled because the springs are under a smaller 
			load, while the cloth droops more and is more wrinkled at higher desntiy. Finally, we see that at very low damping, the cloth
			swings wildly and takes a while to settle. At 0% damping, it never settles and continues to swing back and forth. As the damping
			goes up, the cloth stops swinging and starts falling more and more slowly. The point at which the cloth stops swinging seems to be around 
			20% damping. </p>
		<p>
			Finally, we include an image of the cloth pinned at 4 points. We used the default parameters. </p>

		<h2> Part 3 </h2>
		<p>
			We first show the cloth draped over a sphere with 3 different k values. </p>
		<h3> Cloth over Sphere, k = 500 N/m </h3>
		<img src="sphere_500.png" width="480" height="auto">
		<h3> Cloth over Sphere, k = 5000 N/m </h3>

		<h3> Cloth over Sphere, k = 50000 N/m </h3>
		<img src="sphere_50000.png" width="480" height="auto">
		<p> 
			At a low k value, the cloth hangs lower and fits much more tightly around the shape of the sphere. As the k value gets
			higher, the cloth does not hang as low and becomes stiffer, sticking out more instead of bending around the sphere. </p>
		<p>
			Next, we show the cloth lying peacefully on the plane (although it does vibrate a bit). </p>
		<h3> Cloth on Plane </h3>

		<h2> Part 4 </h2>
		<p>
			We start by showing the falling, self-colliding cloth at 3 different points in time. </p>
		<h3> Falling Cloth, Start </h3>
		<img src="fall_1.png" width="480" height="auto">
		<h3> Falling Cloth, Middle </h3>
		<img src="fall_2.png" width="480" height="auto">
		<h3> Falling Cloth, End </h3>
		<img src="fall_3.png" width="480" height="auto">
		<p>
			Now, we show the fall again, first with a fixed density of 15 g/cm^2 and varying k, and then with a fixed k of 5000 N/m and a
			varying density. </p>
		<h3> Falling Cloth, k = 500 N/m, Start </h3>
		<img src="fall_500_1.png" width="480" height="auto">
		<h3> Falling Cloth, k = 500 N/m, Middle </h3>

			We notice that when the spring constant is lower, the cloth makes more folds as it falls, and it is more folded in its 
			final resting position. As we raise k, there are less folds as the cloth falls and it is more unrolled in it final resting
			position. When we lower the density, we get the opposite effect. The cloth makes fewer folds as it falls, and is more unrolled
			in its final resting position. At higher density, the cloth folds more as it falls and ends up more folded in its resting position. </p>
		
		<h2> Part 5 </h2>
		<p>
			A shader program is a program that runs on the GPU seperately from the main cloth renderer at the same time. Given some input,
			the shader outputs a single 4D vector. This can represent color (r,g,b,a) at a certain point in the image, for instance. The vertex
			shader is in charge of transforming vertices' properties, such as their position and normal vectors. It both calculates the final
			position of a given vertex, and produces variables (varyings) that the fragment shader will use. The rasterization occurs,
			and then the fragment shader computes a color using the varyings created by the vertex shader. Together, by computing
			geometric quantities with the vertex shader and then using these to compute a color in the fragment shader, we can
			create lighting and material effects. </p>
		<p>
			The Blinn-Phong shading model works by combining three different lighting effects. It includes an ambient term which captures
			even shading that does not depend on any light source. This produces an even hue.
			Next, it includes a diffuse term, which is shading that is independent of view direction,
			but it it does depend on a light source. This term gives a matte appearance. Finally, it includes a specular term, which
			does depend on view direction. It uses the half-vector to compute when we are near the mirror direction, and then we can
			produce a glare. This is possible because the half-vector is closer to the normal when we are closer to the mirror direction.
			In the Blinn-Phong model, we can control the relative contributions of these three terms, and change a p value which controls
			how sharp the reflection in the specular term is. </p>
		<p>
			Now, we show the cloth with each component of the Blinn-Phong model separately, and then the entire model together.
			We use k_a = 0.1, I_a = (1, 1, 1), k_d = 1, k_s = 0.5, and p = 64. </p>

		<h3> Blinn-Phong Shading, All Effects </h3>
		<img src="phong_all.png" width="480" height="auto">
		<p>
			We see that each component indeed gives the effect described. When we combine them all, we get pretty realistic looking shading! </p>
		<p> Now, we show the cloth with the texture of the California state flag. </p>

			Next, we give an example of a bump map. We use the included tablecloth image as the texture, because we choose where to put bumps
			based on where the image is the most red. So, we get a nice square pattern on the sphere and the cloth. We use a height of 2
			and a normal of 2. </p>
		<h3> Bump Mapping, Sphere </h3>

		<h3> Bump Mapping, Cloth </h3>
		<img src="bump_cloth.png" width="480" height="auto">
		<p> 
			Now, we show the same texture with displacement mapping. We now use a height of 200 and a normal of 0.02. </p>
		<h3> Displacement Mapping, Sphere </h3>
		<img src="displacement_sphere.png" width="480" height="auto">
		<h3> Displacement Mapping, Cloth </h3>
		<img src="displacement_cloth.png" width="480" height="auto">
		<p>
			In bump mapping, we simply modify the normals of points according to the texture so that the light is reflected off of them differently,
			and we get appearance of a texture on the image. In displacement mapping, we change the actual positions of points on the cloth as well,
			and so we get a more three dimensional looking texture in the final rendering. Comparing the two mapping types, we see that although
			the images look very similar, the displacement mapping image looks less flat. </p>
		<p>
			FILL IN COMPARISON AT DIFFERENT COARSENESS. </p>
		<p>
			Finally, we show the mirror shader on both the sphere and the cloth. </p>
