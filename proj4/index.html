		<h1> Project 4 </h1>
		<h2> Overview </h2>
		
		
		<h2> Part 1 </h2>
		<p>
			We first show the cloth wireframe with different constraints. </p>
		<h3> Wireframe, No Shear </h3>

		<h3> Wireframe, Only Shear </h3>
		<img src="only_shear.png" width="480" height="360">
		<h3> Wireframe, All Constraints </h3>
		<img src="all_constraints.png" width="480" height="360">
		<p>
			Comparing the different images, we see that the shearing constraints connect different masses diagonally, while the 
			structural and bending constraints connect masses in a line. </p>
		
		<h2> Part 2 </h2>
		<p>
			We first show the cloth pinned at 2 points, with different parameters changed. </p>
		<h3> 2 Point Pinned Cloth, k = 10 N/m </h3>

			First, we notice that as we change k, the cloth falls at the same speed, but it hangs lower around the 2 pinned points and becomes
			more wrinkled when the spring constant is lower, since the springs stretch more easily. When the spring constant it very high,
			the cloth is more stiff and becomes less wrinkled. Next, we notice that changing the density also does not change the speed at
			which the cloth falls. However, at low density, the cloth is more stiff and less wrinkled because the springs are under a smaller 
			load, while the cloth droops more and is more wrinkled at higher desntiy. Finally, we see that at very low damping, the cloth
			swings wildly and takes a while to settle. At 0% damping, it never settles and continues to swing back and forth. As the damping
			goes up, the cloth stops swinging and starts falling more and more slowly. The point at which the cloth stops swinging seems to be around 
			20% damping. </p>
		<p>
			Finally, we include an image of the cloth pinned at 4 points. We used the default parameters. </p>
