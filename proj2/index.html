		<h1> Project 2 </h1>
		<h2> Overview </h2>
		<p> We started by implementing de Casteljau's algorithm for Bezier curves, which allows us to recursively generate the curves by lerping control points 
		with respect to some varying parameter. Then, we implemented the same algorithm for Bezier surfaces, which uses two parameters, and runs the algorithm
		first along each point in a row to get control points for a perpendicular Bezier curve, and then we run the algorithm to get that curve. By varying
		both parameters, we move the perpendicular curve and the point along it, recovering the whole surface. In these parts, we learned how
		the simple lerp subroutine at the center of de Casteljau's algorithm can be repeatedly used to buiild up a more complicated procedure
		that generates curves and surfaces. </p>
		<p> Next, we implemented vertex normals for Phong shading. To do this, we calculated weighted normals of adjacent faces to compute the normal
			at the vertex. This part introduced us to working with the halfedge data structure, and illustrated how the cross product can be used
			to determine area. Then, we implemented edge flipping, which repositions an edge within the mesh. To do this, we had to make 
			careful use of the halfedge data structure to reassign necessary pointers. We learned the value of drawing a detailed diagram of the
			setup to minimize errors. Then, we implemented edge splitting, where we split an edge in half, created a new vertex at the center,
			and added additional edges connecting the vertex. In this part, we had to reassign pointers in the halfedge data structure and also
			create new objects and assign their values, and we again found it very valuable to make a detailed diagram to reference while making
			pointer assignments. We also ran into our first major bug in this portion, which was caused by forgetting to reassign certain values.
			We learned that it is better to write reassignments in an organized manner so it is easy to make sure everything has been reassigned
			and nothing was left out. To solve this, we had to carefully examine the pointers to each object in our mesh, and think about
			which connections should be present.
			Finally, we implemented loop subdivision, where we split each edge and then flipped certain edges to divide
			each triangle into four pieces, and then reassigned the positions of each vertex to keep the smoothness of the mesh. We also ran into
			a major bug where we categorized some old edges that shouldn't be flipped as new, which caused strange outputs. To fix this, we broke
			down the algorithm into its basic pieces and executed it by hand to compare against the code's output. By looking carefully at the 
			algorithm, we were able to identify where the issue was and fix it. </p>
		<h2> Task 1 </h2>
		<p>
			To implement de Casteljau's algorithm, we lerp each pair of adjacent control points
		that make up the Bezier curve to get new points in between. Then, we lerp each adjacent pair of lerped points, 
		and we repeat recursively until we only have one point left. This is a point on the Bezier curve.
		By varying the lerp parameter between 0 and 1, we get all of the points on the Bezier curve. </p>

		<h2> Task 2 </h2>
		<p> To extend the algorithm, we first apply the algorithm to each row to get a sequence of control points that describe a Bezier curve
			perpendicular to the rows, and then we apply the algorithm to this sequence of points to get a single point on the Bezier curve.
			The parameter u between 0 and 1 determines our lerps on each row, and the parameter v determines the lerps of the points from
			each row. Varying v gives us the entire Bezier curve perpendicular to the rows, and varying u gives us different Bezier curves
			that are perpendicular to the rows. By varying both, we form the entire surface. </p>

		<h2> Task 3 </h2>
		<p>To implement area-weighted vertex normals, we first took a half-edge from the vertex. Then, to get each face, we took the face associated
		with the half edge, then took twin->next before repeating. We stopped when returning to the original half edge. Given each face, we computed
		the area-weighted normal by computing the sum of the cross products between each pair of vertices along the face (by going around with half edges),
		which will give us the direction of the normal weighted by area times some constant. Then, to compute the vertex normal, we simply add 
		these area weighted normals and then make the vector a unit vector, so the additional constant vactor on the area weighted normals does
			not effect the calculation.</p>

		<h2> Task 4 </h2>
		<p>We started by making a drawing of an edge and the two triangles it interfaces with. We labeled all relevant quantities.</p>
		<h3> Diagram </h3>
		<img src="drawing.jpg" width="398" height="600">
		<p> If the edge was on the boundary, we immediately returned it and went no futher.
		If it was not on the boundary, we first fetched all of the relevant quantities using the half edge associated with the edge.
		Then, we first reassigned next for h, h1, and h4 so they point to each other. We then reassigned next for t (twin of h), h2, and h3 so they also 
		point in a loop. Then, we changed h4 to have face f1, and made f1 have half edge h1. We also made h2 have face f2 and f2 have half edge h2.
		Then, we made h have vertex v1 and v1 have half edge h. Finally, we made t have vertex v2 and v2 have half edge t. In the end, we did not
		have to make any changes to the edge e0, since it was still associated with the same half edge. By making careful use of the diagram,
		we were able to get all of the rules correct on the first try, so debugging was not necessary for us. Thus, we didn't really develop
			any significant debugging tricks, besides simply referencing our diagram. </p>

		<h3> After Flipping </h3>
		<img src="flipped.png" width="791" height="592">
		<p> The one debugging piece we did have to do was replace CIter with Iter, because we realized that nothing could be changed when using CIters. </p>
		
		<h2> Task 5 </h2>
		<p>We started by again making a diagram of an edge and the two triangles it interfaces with, and then expanding that diagram into a diagram of four
			triangles with split edges. We again labeled all relevant quantities.</p>
		<h3> Diagram </h3>
		<img src="diagram2.jpg" width="398" height="600">
		<p> Again, we immediately returned if an edge was on the boundary. If the edge was not on the boundary, we again first fetched all existing
			labeeled quantities using the half edge structure, and then we created all the new halfedges, vertices, and so on using the appropriate
			functions. Then, using the diagram, we went through each object (halfedge, vertex, edge, face) and updated each of its pointers to
			match with what we had on the diagram. We did not have any major implementation tricks besides using the diagram. As a debugging trick,
			we used the provided check_for method, to check how many things pointed to each vertex, which ultimately revealed the biggest bug
			that we encountered in our code.</p>
		<h3> Before Splitting </h3>
		<img src="normal.png" width="791" height="592">
		<h3> After Splitting </h3>
		<img src="split.png" width="791" height="592">
		<h3> After Splitting and Flipping </h3>
		<img src="split_flip.png" width="791" height="592">
		<p> After implementing the updates in our diagrams, we found that the program would crash upon trying to split an edge. After running through
			the function, we found that it was only crashing after our function call ended. Next, we used the included check_for function to look
			at where each of our objects was referenced. When doing this, we found that some vertices were being referenced by 7 halfedges when they
			should have only been referenced by 6. This made us realize that there was some halfedge which was not gettings its parameters updated.
			Sure enough, looking back, we realized we had to forgot to update the halfedges h and t in our diagram, and had simply left their original
			parameters. Fixing this also fixed our bug. Luckily, this was the only serious bug we encountered in this part.</p>
		
		<h2> Task 6 </h2>
		<p> To implement the loop subdivision algorithm, we first used the vertex iterator to calculate the new positions of each old vertex,
			using the formula from lecture. We stored this position in the newPosition field for later. To do this, we had to iterate over
			the neighbors of each vertex, which we did with the halfedge data structure. We then iterated over each edge, and stored the position
			for the new vertex that we would generate once we split the edge. We again used the formula from lecture and used the halfedge
			data structure to get relevant vertex positions. We stored the position in the newPosition argument. We also used the first two
			loops to flag each vertex and edge as old vertices and edges, before we added any new components for this run of the algorithm.</p>
		<p> Next, we again iterated over each edge to split all old edges. To check if an edge was old, we checked if both vertices connected to it were old,
			to make sure that we did not split any edge which was already split in this run. After splitting the edge, we used the halfedge data structure
			to flag the new vertex and the new edges which were not part of the split edge as new. We also copied the position for the new vertex from
			the corresponding edge into the newPosition field. Next, we again iterated over all edges, and flipped
			any new edge which was connected to one new and one old vertex, as specified in lecture. Finally, we iterated over all vertices and updated
			their positions using the values stored in the newPosition field. </p>
		<p> Generally, meshes become smoothed, with the positions of the vertices of the smaller triangles interpolating the positions of the vertices
			of the original triangles. We give a general example with the torus. </p>
		<h3> Torus Subdivision </h3>
		<img src="sub0.png" width="791" height="592">
		<img src="sub1.png" width="791" height="592">
		<img src="sub2.png" width="791" height="592">
		<img src="sub3.png" width="791" height="592">
		<p> In particular, sharp edges and corners tend to become rounded because there is not enough resolution
			around the sharp corners and edges to keep them from getting smoothed when the new vertices are added. To mitigate this effect,
			we can perform many splits around the edges and corners, so that there is less smoothing that occurs when we subdivide, and so
			the edges remain sharp. We give an example of this below. </p>
		<h3> Torus Subdivision, Partially Sharpened </h3>

		<img src="sharp3.png" width="791" height="592">
		<p> When applying loop subdivision to the cube, it becomes asymmetric because the mesh triangles are not symmetric, and so the added vertices
			are not symmetric and the cube bulges in different places. To correct this, we split the diagonal edges on each face so that the
			mesh was symmetric before applying the loop subdivision. We see below that this fixed the asymmetry in the subdivided cube. </p>
