            <h2 align="middle">Current Accomplishments</h2>

            <p>
                Currently, we have created fluid particles that behave according to the algorithm described in this
                <a href="http://mmacklin.com/pbf_sig_preprint.pdf">paper</a>, though we currently do not have the particles
                behaving exactly as desired.
            </p>

            <h3 align="middle">Progress</h3>

            <p>
                We began by modifying the Project 4 Clothsim code and transforming the cloth into a 3D array of fluid particles,
                which we placed into a bounding box of planes to act as a container. We then attempted to implement Algorithm 1 from
                <a href="http://mmacklin.com/pbf_sig_preprint.pdf">Macklin and Muller's paper</a>
                to model particle behavior in a fluid, using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics approach. In this algorithm, we first calculate the forces acting upon each particle and
                predict a position for them. We then determine what other particles neighbor them by using a modified version of the spatial map grid from project 4. 
                We look at particles in all the boxes adjacent to the box our current particle is in. We then
                repeatedly do the necessary calculations to enforce incompressibility. To model the interactions between particles, we first implemented 
                the poly6 and spiky kernel functions
                (equations 20 and 21 from <a href="https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/publications/sca03.pdf">this paper</a>). 
                These were used to compute the density constraints and approximate the gradient of the density constraints, respectively.
                We then in turn use the density constraints to compute changes in the positions of the particles. We then update our particle positions to handle collisions
                with geometry as in project 4, and then finally perform the position update to respect incompressibility.

            <h3 align="middle">Results</h3>

            <p>
                Currently, we are able to create a cube of fluid particles within our bounding boxes. However, our implementation 
                of the fluid particle algorithm is somewhat unstable, blowing up after a few simulation steps.
                
            </p>


            <h3 align="middle">Plan Updates</h3>

            <p>
                Accounting for where we are in the project now, we have updated our plan as follows. We will try to fix our current bug and get a fully 
                working basic fluid simulation by the end of the week. Next week will be dedicated to implementing magnetic effects. If we pull ahead
                of schedule in either stage, we will dedicate the remaining days to implementing shaders. We will implement more complicated geometry
                only if we are massively ahead of schedule.
