		<h2>Task 1</h2>
		<p>
		To rasterize the triangles, we first computed the bounding box for the triangle. This was done by looking at the min and max x and y values across all vertices.
		We then perform three line tests for each point in the bounding box, first assuming a counterclockwise orientation and then a clockwise orientation for the edges of the triangle.
		If the point was found to be inside the triangle for either of the orientations, or on one of the edges of the triangle, we fill the pixel.
